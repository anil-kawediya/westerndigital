firmware_upgrade_session.py

Simulated test harness for Section 5: Firmware Upgrade & Session Continuity (macOS simulation).

Scenarios simulated:
 - Firmware reset/reload with active IPsec sessions (expect session teardown or recovery)
 - Driver reload during active encrypted I/O
 - Session persistence across firmware upgrade (simulated state preserved or lost)
 - Check for potential data leakage after upgrade (simulated checksums / memory wipe verification)
